Test repository for AIM240 class
I have used Git off and on since about 2016 but only for very brief periods and without much depth. All of my prior experience has been with the command-line. The article was interesting because I guess I never really understood the difference between Git and GitHub and, honestly, thought they were the same thing. So, this article (and video) were helpful in explaining that Git is the open source distributed version control system. GitHub, owned by Microsoft, is a for-profit company that has a user-interface for collaboration and that is user friendly. I also (re)learned that a pull request is asking the code owner to include your code, along with the changes you have incorporated. I would have guessed that a pull request was asking the code owner permission to use the code but that is branch or fork.
